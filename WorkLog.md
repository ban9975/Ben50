## Work Log
#### Before 11/1
* Try on conductive fabric. The fabric is not stretchable. It becomes longer after being pulled.

* Ben50 using rubber sheet and conductive jersey.
    * Rubber sheet can not hold consistant resistance during static stretching.

    * Conductive jersey has low resistance, which makes the current high and therefore not suitable for our device.

### 11/1 Meeting
#### 11/3
* Measure the stretching resistance of rubber cord in different length.

* Measure the stretching resistance of 3cm z-shaped rubber cord. Note that the cord setup is different from now, so the measurement has to be re-do.

### 11/15 Meeting
#### Todo
- [ ] Re-measure the data of conductive fabric and rubber sheet.
- [ ] Measure more fine-grained data of rubber cord.
    - [ ] Different length.
    - [ ] More round.
- [ ] Draw data into chart.

#### 11/16
* Arrange files to Github and HackMD.
